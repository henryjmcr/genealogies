Previous analyses of Jowett’s translation have suggested&amp;nbsp;this translator made significant interventions in the text as part of his interpretation of the History, in some key instances dramatically downplaying the political agency of ordinary Athenian citizens in the representation of classical democracy that Thucydides provides.</description>

&amp;nbsp; The opposition between an ‘original text’ and a translation has often been criticised from the viewpoint that it reduces the status of the translation to that of a mere derivative product. Yet the notion of an original also conceals the fact that texts do not appear out of nothing. While for the most part not consisting of explicitly translated material, the Internet corpus constitutes a complex web of references and interactions that point towards a number of often conflicting sites of genealogical heritage.</description>

&amp;nbsp; The Internet subcorpus features a variety of sources on the right and left of the political spectrum, all engaged in contesting different aspects of mainstream political and scientific culture. Topics such as migration, climate change, democracy, protest movements, race, identity, neoliberalism, sexism and taxation all receive extensive attention. Focusing on a topic such as migration, it is possible to interrogate the avowed politics of the radical left through a critical discourse analysis of the way in which migrants and similar categories of outsiders are talked about in left leaning outlets such as ROAR Magazine, Discover Society, Mother Jones and Open Democracy.</description>

Emily Wilson’s translation of the Odyssey has been the catalyst for a lot of this discussion, and she has been outspoken about the deficiencies that she sees in previous translations, including sexism and the erasure of slavery. This has all been very timely for me, because for the first time I’m creating my own translations of literary and historical texts.</description>

      <description>Call for Papers 13-15 December 2018 Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Nova University of Lisbon  Conference Website  In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the linguistic situation in Europe was one of remarkable fluidity. Latin, the great scholarly lingua franca of the medieval period, was beginning to crack as the tectonic plates shifted beneath it, but the vernaculars had not yet crystallized into the national languages that they would become a century later, and bi- or multilingualism was still rife.</description>

      <description>Exile, refuge and the Greek polis: between justice and humanity Dr. Benjamin Gray 20 February 2015  This seminar addresses the place of exiles and refugees in the Greek polis (city-state), with a focus on the later Classical and Hellenistic periods (c. 400-100 B.C.). It addresses the different forms of protection and aid granted by Greek poleis and their citizens to Greeks displaced through war and civil strife. It also analyses the range of arguments advanced by ancient Greeks for protecting or helping exiles and refugees, including the self-presentation of displaced Greeks themselves.</description>

      <description>Aileen Das | British Library blog Link: https://www.bl.uk/greek-manuscripts/articles/the-transmission-of-greek-philosophy-and-medicine   Ancient Greek philosophy and medical writing were extremely influential on later thought, both in the West and in the East. Aileen Das traces some of the strands of this remarkable journey, from Greek to Syriac, Arabic, and Latin.   Severus Sebokht (d. 666/667 CE) writes: [Philosophy] does not belong to the Greeks alone, but can be acquired by all who are diligent, whether they are Greeks or Barbarians.</description>

      <description>Jane Gallagher John Rylands Library Special Collections Blog 19 September, 2017 https://rylandscollections.wordpress.com/2017/09/19/truth-in-translation/amp/ How do you define truth? In medieval Europe, it was often thought that truth came from ancient texts in Latin or Greek, passed down through generations and only accessible to those who could read them. The truth in these texts could then be spoken to others who couldn’t read, or didn’t understand ancient languages. And few texts were more important in European society than the Bible.</description>

      <description>The OpenITI team, building on the foundational open-source OCR work of Leipzig University’s Alexander von Humboldt Chair for Digital Humanities, has reported Optical Character Recognition (OCR) percentage accuracy rates for classical Arabic-script texts in the high nineties. These numbers are based on tests of seven different Arabic-script texts of varying quality and typefaces, totaling over 7,000 lines (approx. 400 pages, 87,000 words). These accuracy rates not only represent a distinct improvement over the actual accuracy rates of the various proprietary OCR options for classical Arabic-script texts, but, equally important, they are produced using an open-source OCR software called Kraken (developed by Benjamin Kiessling, Leipzig University), that is to be made freely available to the broader Islamic, Persian, and Arabic Studies communities.</description>

      <description>Karla Mallette Middle Eastern Literatures, 2017 Abstract Translation occupies a central place in current theories of world literature, but it is not the only way in which texts circulate beyond their original cultural and temporal contexts to become world literature. This article explores the shifting relationship between language and territory, contrasting modern languages as territorially bound by the nation-state with pre-modern cosmopolitan languages that transcended territorial location. Drawing upon the complex translation process of the works of Aristotle from the Abbasid translation movement of the eighth through 10th centuries to the multiple print editions of competing translations of Aristotle’s works published in Venice in the 16th century, the article argues that world literature often results from the confluence of the broad reach of a cosmopolitan language and the mobility of translation.</description>

      <description>Dr. Ian Alan Paul (Al-Quds Bard College, Abu Dis, Palestine) is a transdisciplinary artist, theorist, and curator. Drawing upon his fieldwork undertaken between 2013 and 2015, this event at the University of Manchester explored the myriad forms of contestation that emerged between the diverse legacies of the January 2011 uprising and the subsequent 2013 military coup in Cairo, Egypt. The presentation features sections of the online documentary The Conditions of Possibility (2016), reflections on the production of the documentary, and analysis of the competing forms of democratic possibility and suffocating security that continue to unfold in the present.</description>

      <description>Thursday 13 July - Saturday 15 July 2017 Freie Universität Berlin The international conference will investigate the neglected history of Arabic-Islamic textual practices and interpretative methods in the early modern world from a global and comparative perspective. Although philology has always been a global knowledge practice, no such account of its history has ever been written. Indeed, wherever texts exist, a method of making sense of them has existed as well.</description>

      <description>Wieringa S, Engebretsen E, Heggen K, Greenhalgh T. Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice, 2017 Abstract Evidence-based health care (EBHC), previously evidence-based medicine (EBM), is considered by many to have modernized health care and brought it from an authority-based past to a more rationalist, scientific grounding. But recent concerns and criticisms pose serious challenges and urge us to look at the fundamentals of a changing EBHC. In this paper, we present French philosopher Bruno Latour&#39;s vision on modernity as a framework to discuss current changes in the discourse on EBHC/EBM.</description>

      <description>I am the second Post-Doctoral Research Associate to start work on the Genealogies of Knowledge project. Having received my BA in French Studies from the University of Sheffield, I came to Manchester in 2012 as a student enrolled on the MA in Translation and Interpreting Studies programme. During this course, I developed an interest in recent research on web-based communities of non-professional translators, as well as in socio-narrative theory as a conceptual framework for the study of translation.</description>

      <description>David M. Berry, Anders Fagerjord As the twenty-first century unfolds, computers challenge the way in which we think about culture, society and what it is to be human: areas traditionally explored by the humanities. In a world of automation, Big Data, algorithms, Google searches, digital archives, real-time streams and social networks, our use of culture has been changing dramatically. The digital humanities give us powerful theories, methods and tools for exploring new ways of being in a digital age.</description>

      <description>Ilka Eickhof | Madamasr.com | April 20, 2017 Economic language has seeped deep into the everyday in western Europe, and is being imported into Egypt through funding. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Since local state and non-state funding is either scarce or limited in scope, a significant part of Cairo’s contemporary culture field — specifically visual art, dance and partly also theater — depends on funding from western European cultural institutions.</description>

      <description>Deadline - 25 May 2017 Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin From the early Byzantine period, a fundamental change in scientific writing is apparent: Instead of argument-based discursive writing, compilations from older treatises viewed as exemplary are found, compilations that have “encyclopaedic” and paedagogic rather than scientific aims. The most comprehensive writings of this genre are the thematically arranged collections of excerpts (&#34;encyclopaedias&#34;) compiled by Oribasius, Aetius and Paul of Aegina (4th-7th century AD).</description>

      <description>30 June and 1 July 2017 London South Bank University Neo-liberal capitalism has asserted the primacy of “knowledge” in the cultural sphere. Its “Knowledge Economy” agenda has renewed the dialectics of reason and faith, autonomy and control, progress and tradition. “Creative Industries”, with their attendant emphasis on innovation, information and intellectual property, loom large in this renewal – as do accelerating market and managerial logics in the structures of education and governance that feed the broader “Cultural Economy”.</description>

      <description>The series Languages and Culture in History studies the role foreign languages have played in the creation of the linguistic and cultural heritage of Europe, both western and eastern, and at the individual, community, national or transnational level. At the heart of this series is the historical evolution of linguistic and cultural policies, internal as well as external, and their relationship with linguistic and cultural identities. The series takes an interdisciplinary approach to a variety of historical issues: the diffusion, the supply and the demand for foreign languages, the history of pedagogical practices, the historical relationship between languages in a given cultural context, the public and private use of foreign languages – in short, every way foreign languages intersect with local languages in the cultural realm.</description>

But while fast-paced scientific discoveries and technological innovations have improved the health of vast populations worldwide, some sections of society are becoming more and more disillusioned with what they regard as rigid, unholistic or wholesale treatments offered by the medical profession, and turning to alternative approaches to health and well-being.</description>

      <description>7-9 December 2017 1st Call for Papers &amp;nbsp; The production and circulation of knowledge across temporal and cultural spaces is a well-established research theme among classicists and historians of political thought, ideas, science and medicine, but recent developments have opened up new perspectives on this area of study. The study of social knowledge flows has advanced our understanding of these transit processes in critical and productive ways. While earlier ‘diffusionist’ models of knowledge production and distribution were predicated on the ascendancy of European thought and science, and the treatment of other cultures as no more than producers of data to be collected, theorised and understood, emerging models of social knowledge foreground how the very process of circulation produces new knowledge and recognise the contribution of all actors and locations traversed by such flows over time.</description>

      <description>In this article, Professor Charles Burnett, a world expert in the history of Islamic influences in Europe at The Warburg Institute (London University), retraces the impact the Latin translations of Arabic texts of science and philosophy had on the intellectual progress of Europe in the decisive period that preceded and prepared the Renaissance. The article is based on an interview conducted with him in 2004. Imagine a period in history, a time when Arab and Islamic cultures were at their zenith, renowned for their learning and scholarship.</description>

      <description>I am happy to introduce myself as the Genealogies of Knowledge project’s new Ph.D. Student. At my alma mater, KU Leuven, I was trained as a linguist and literary scholar, specialising in the Dutch and English languages. During my early educational years, I developed a keen interest in poetry and rhetorical narratology, research fields which I tended to approach through the lens of contemporary philosophy. After obtaining my Master’s degree in Western Literature, I worked as a research assistant for the Leuven-based MDRN research lab, where I was exposed to the literary production of the modernist period.</description>

      <description>Plans for holding the first international conference organized by the Genealogies of Knowledge team are well under way. The conference is intended to provide a space for scholars from diverse disciplinary backgrounds to discuss various aspects of the impact of translation and other processes of mediation on the evolution of concepts across time and space. It will also provide an opportunity for engaging with current discourses that contest the foundations of political and scientific life, with methodological and theoretical issues relating to the use of large electronic corpora for tracing the evolution and contestation of concepts, and with the role of historical and modern lingua francas in constructing knowledge(s) across the full spectrum of human experience.</description>

      <description>Peter Adamson (Professor of philosophy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich) In European antiquity, philosophers largely wrote in Greek. Even after the Roman conquest of the Mediterranean and the demise of paganism, philosophy was strongly associated with Hellenic culture. The leading thinkers of the Roman world, such as Cicero and Seneca, were steeped in Greek literature; Cicero even went to Athens to pay homage to the home of his philosophical heroes.</description>

Both works are remarkable as the products and the objects of translation throughout the middle ages. Successive recensions of the Alexander Romance were translated, either from the original Greek or from Latin translations, into numerous vernacular languages until there were popular versions of the Romance in circulation from Iceland to Indonesia.</description>

The project aims to historicize present notions of translation by analysing a test case at the interstices of nature and culture. It examines how different kinds of human bodies were constituted through translation in medical, ethnographic and religious discourses in the early modern global world. It is concerned with conceptual and physical dimensions of the human body, and how these intersect with translation as a practice and a concept.</description>

To date, much academic research about data visualisation has focused on individualistic and micro-level factors like memorability and speed of comprehension and has not attended to the social, cultural, political work that visualisations do, the contexts in which they circulate, and the mutually constitutive relationships between visualisations and their contexts.</description>

      <description>The construction of medieval Arab medicine Edited by Pauline Koetschet and Peter E. Pormann (2016, Institut français du Proche-Orient) The history of pre-modern Arabic medicine remains shrouded in mystery, not because we would not have sources, but because in their majority, these sources have not been edited or studied. These are the sources that form the basis of the articles published in this book. These deal, inter alia, the transfer of medical knowledge and the construction of the Arab medicine from Greek sources, Indian, Persian and translated into Arabic, and the changes made to past medical knowledge.</description>

      <description>Bettina Dietza Annals of Science, 2015 Summary This article discusses translations of Linnaeus&#39; Systema naturae into various European languages, in the context of successively expanded editions of Linnaeus&#39; writings. The ambition and intention of most translators was not only to make the Systema naturae accessible for practical botanical use by a wider readership, but also to supplement and correct it, and thus to shape it. This form of textual engineering, becoming increasingly complex with each translation cycle, shaped the external appearance of new editions of the Systema, and reflected the modular architecture of a botanical system designed for expansion.</description>

      <description>Scott Frickel, Sahra Gibbon, Jeff Howard,Joanna Kempner, Gwen Ottinger, and David J. Hess Science, Technology, &amp;amp; Human Values 35(4), July 2010 Summary &#39;Undone science&#39; is a term used to describe areas of research that are left unfunded, incomplete, or generally ignored but which social movements or civil society organizations often identify as worthy of more research. This article draws on recent studies to elaborate the concept of undone science as it relates to the political construction of research agendas.</description>

      <description>Patrice Bret Annals of Science, 2015 Summary Eighteenth-century scientific translation was not just a linguistic or intellectual affair. It included numerous material aspects requiring a social organization to marshal the indispensable human and non-human actors. Paratexts and actors&#39; correspondences provide a good observatory to get information about aspects such as shipments and routes, processes of translation and language acquisition (dictionaries, grammars and other helpful materials, such as translated works in both languages), texts acquisition and dissemination (including author&#39;s additions and corrections, oral presentations in academic meetings and announcements of forthcoming translations).</description>

      <description>Alex de Waal Boston Review: June 06, 2016 http://bostonreview.net/world/alex-de-waal-writing-human-rights The power to accuse someone of a grave crime on the basis of hearsay is a heady one. I have done it, and I faced the consequences of being wrong. Twenty years ago in the Nuba Mountains of central Sudan, I met a man, Chief Hussein Karbus, whose murder I had reported three years earlier. He was introduced to me by the man I had accused of ordering his death, a leader of the Sudan People’s Liberation Army.</description>

      <description>The Future Learn platform has introduced an online course developed by Lancaster University. The course offers a practical introduction to the methodology of corpus linguistics for researchers in social sciences and humanities. The course aims to:  Equip those taking the course with skills necessary for collecting and analysing large digital collections of text (corpora); Provide educational support for those who want to use the corpus method; demonstrate the use of corpus linguistics in the humanities, especially History Give a sense of the incredibly wide uses that corpora have been put to; Allow those with an interest in language, who have not heard of the corpus approach before, a new way of looking at language; Demonstrate that corpus approaches to social science can offer valuable insight into social reality by investigating the use and manipulation of language in society.</description>

 [siteorigin_widget class=&#34;WP_Widget_Media_Image&#34;][/siteorigin_widget]The Translation and Contestation of Political and Scientific Concepts across Time and Space: A Corpus-Based Study (Prof. Mona Baker)
This seminar introduced a large, interdisciplinary research project based at the University of Manchester in the UK and funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. The project involves compiling large electronic corpora of ancient Greek, medieval Arabic, Latin and Modern English to examine how central concepts in the humanities and sciences have been (re)translated into these three lingua francas, and how they have been interpreted and reinterpreted as they entered new cultural and temporal spaces.</description>

      <description>Jessica Leigh Doyle British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Volume 43, Issue 3, 2016 Since the early 1990s support for civil society has constituted the linchpin of international efforts in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) to promote democratisation and democratic values.The rationale for this support lies in an understanding of civil society drawn from a liberal-democratic model, which dominates debates about civil society. This article highlights the inaccuracies of this model when applied to the MENA and, using Turkey as an example, draws attention to the perils of supporting civil society organisations (CSOs) based on its conjectures.</description>

      <description>Genealogies of Knowledge Corpus The Genealogies of Knowledge corpus is designed to enable researchers to trace the trajectory of key concepts as they enter different cultural and temporal spaces, predominantly but not exclusively through the mediation of various forms of translation. The current focus of the project is on three historical lingua francas (Arabic, Latin and English) and on concepts relating to the body politic and to scientific, expert discourse. However, the research team is developing a set of resources and a range of methodologies that can support future studies involving different lingua francs (French being an obvious choice in the European context), different historical moments (perhaps the Enlightenment), and different constellations of concepts.</description>

      <description>The Arabic and Latin Glossary is a dictionary of the vocabulary of the Arabic–Latin translations of the Middle Ages. It unites the entries of all existing Arabic–Latin glossaries in modern editions of medieval works. The Glossary has a double aim: to improve our understanding of the Arabic influence in Europe, especially with respect to scientific vocabulary, and to provide a lexical tool for the understanding of Arabic and Latin scientific texts.</description>

      <description>The Guardian recently featured an article including examples of important manuscripts illustrating how, from the ninth to the nineteenth centuries, scholars and scribes used Arabic as a lingua franca to debate and develop scientific ideas. Arabic-speaking scholars translated classical Greek, Persian and even Sanskrit texts on topics such as medicine, mathematics and astronomy. These scholars went far beyond translation and preservation and fostered a unique and vibrant scientific culture within the Arabic-speaking world.</description>

Except for some isolated references (Cronin 2003; Baker 2006; Bassnett 2013), there has been no sustained engagement with the issue, let alone an attempt to do what Paul Ricoeur has done for narrative theory in his Temps et récit (1983).</description>

While all ‘religions’ travel and engage in translation of one kind or another, what gets translated? How do the different components of what is currently understood as ‘religion’—texts, practices, experiences, inner faith or belief systems—translate differently? How can we analyze such commonly held beliefs that some languages simply are sacred and should not be translated?</description>

      <description>Genealogies of Knowledge: The Evolution and Contestation of Concepts across Time and Space Democracy, civil society, nation, natural law, human rights, equality, experiment, cause, evidence, truth, validity, expertise – these are all key cultural concepts with a long history that remain central to social and political life today. This project explores how our understanding of these concepts has evolved since they first emerged. It also examines how translation has impacted this transformation, as these concepts have travelled across centuries, languages and cultures.</description>
