He has published in the fields of Islamic philosophical ethics, philosophy of logic and Islamic medicine. At the moment, he is writing a monograph-length genealogy of Avicenna’s (d. 1037) logical theory of <em>if</em>s. In it he hopes to show how Avicenna’s pioneering logical doctrines relating to conditional propositions draw on Greek, Arabic and even Syriac debates about and classifications of logical inference. In medical translation studies, he is interested in tracing how pre-modern Arabic medical texts influenced the reception, conceptualisation and translation of European medical texts in early modern medical schools and institutions of learning in the Middle East.</p></div>

<p>Jan Buts is a Ph.D. student with a background in English and Dutch linguistics and literature. His current project, <em>Prefiguring the Body Politic: Continental Philosophy and Online Alternative Media</em>, focuses on the political significance of structural features of language. The project employs the Genealogies of Knowledge <a href="http://genealogiesofknowledge.net/genealogies-knowledge-corpus/">Modern and Internet subcorpora </a>to trace the recent trajectory of three concepts – community, democracy, and politics. These concepts’ linguistic positioning is studied especially in translations from late twentieth century French philosophy and in a selection of online publications on activism. By thus charting how the idea of the body politic is conceptualised in these texts, the research project  attempts to reassess the relation between discourse and direct action.</p>

<p>David Langslow is Professor of Classics at the University of Manchester. His interests include Ancient Greek and Latin special and technical languages and language contact in the Greek and Roman worlds down to the early medieval period in the West. His first book, <em>Medical Latin in the Roman Empire</em>, was inspired by the question what are the possible and the preferred means of extending the expressive means of a language so as to refer to and discuss new special and technical things. This led to the particular instance of the extension of the Latin language in the first century AD to accommodate the essentially Greek science of medicine, and to general questions around the translating of science. This led in turn on the one hand to wide ranging work on multilingualism as reflected in corpus languages, and on the other to the very particular undertaking (in progress) of the first critical edition of the Latin version of the medical works of the canonical Greek doctor Alexander of Tralles (5th/6th c. AD).</p></div>

Maeve Olohan is Senior Lecturer in Translation Studies and Co-Director of the <a href="http://www.alc.manchester.ac.uk/translation-and-intercultural-studies/">Centre for Translation and Intercultural Studies</a> at the University of Manchester. Her recent research has focused both on the translation of science in historical contexts and on the workplace practices of today’s translation professionals. The common thread running through these studies is the conceptualisation of translation as practice and a concomitant interest in the socialities and materialities of translation, explored further in a monograph on practice-theoretical approaches to translation (Routledge, in preparation). She is the author of <em>Scientific and Technical Translation</em> (2016) and <em>Introducing Corpora in Translation Studies</em> (2004) and editor of <em>Intercultural Faultlines: Research Models in Translation Studies</em> (2000). In 2011 she co-edited, with Myriam Salama-Carr, a special issue of <em>The Translator</em> 17(2) on science in translation.  She serves on the AHRC Peer Review College, the Board of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/translation/programmes/emt/index_en.htm">European Masters in Translation</a> and the Steering Board of <a href="https://artisinitiative.org/">ARTIS</a> (Advancing Research in Translation and Interpreting Studies).</div>

<h3>Former Co-Investigator (April 2016-September 2017)</h3>
<h4>Peter Pormann</h4>
<img class="wp-image-366 size-full alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/test2.jpg" alt="Peter Pormann" width="160" height="180" />After studying Classics, French, and Islamic Studies in Paris (Sorbonne), Hamburg, and Tübingen, I took an MA in Islamic Studies at the University of Leiden, and an M.Phil. and D.Phil in Classics at the University of Oxford (Corpus Christi College). As an undergraduate, my prime motivation in choosing Classics was to understand ‘our’ Western culture, for surely its two main roots were Graeco-Roman Antiquity and the Judaeo-Christian tradition. Little did I know that a third ‘root’, Islamic culture, is intrinsically linked to our own tradition, a fact conveniently forgotten by ideologues of different persuasions. My teaching and research therefore tries to rectify this misconception by investigating the many contacts between Muslims, Jews, and Christians writing in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic, be it in the tenth or the twentieth century.</div>
