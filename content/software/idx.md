<div class="entry-post"><h3>MODNLP-IDX: A corpus indexer</h3>
<p>modnlp-idx: an <a href="http://modnlp.sourceforge.net/doc/">API</a>, library and tools for (inverted) indexing, storage and retrieval of large amounts of text, with (XML-based) handling of meta-data. The modnlp-idx library has been used in the European Parliamentary Comparable and Parallel Corpora (ECPC) project and by the <a href="http://genealogiesofknowledge.net/translational-english-corpus-tec/">Translational English Corpus</a> (TEC) project.</p>
<p>A beta version is currently available which uses the Sleepycat's Java version of the Berkeley DB as a back-end. This beta distribution can be downloaded from the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/modnlp/">project's download area</a>. The files ending in bin-tec.tar.gz, bin-ep.tar.gz, bin-hc.tar.gz contain property files configured for indexing the TEC corpus and the European Parliament Corpus and The House of Commons Corpus respectively. The last two are being collected by the <a href="http://www.ecpc.uji.es/">ECPC</a> project.</p>
<p>Instructions on compiling and running the indexer can be found in the README files contained in the distribution's archives.</p>

<p>Development snapshots can be downloaded through the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/modnlp/">Developer's web page</a> at Sourceforge.net.</p></div>
