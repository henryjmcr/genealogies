<div class="entry-post"><h5>12-14 January 2017
Ajou University, South Korea</h5>
Knowledge production and dissemination have long been of interest to scholars from various disciplinary backgrounds. Within the field of translation studies, the role of translation in the production, transmission and transformation of knowledge has been the focus of recent investigations by a number of research groups, including, but not limited to, the organizers of the <em>Circulation of Academic Thought</em> Conference held in the University of Graz in 2015 and the research team based at the University of Manchester undertaking the UK’s AHRC-funded‘<em>Genealogies of Knowledge</em> Research Project 2016. The efforts of such groups have initiated an exchange of ideas regarding translation as a form of knowledge-making and the cross-cultural circulation of academic thought. At present, more empirical research is needed to further our understanding of the complex ways in which translation has engaged with the production, evolution, and circulation of knowledge.

This three-day <a href="https://artisinitiative.org/">ARTIS</a> training event provides a forum in which established and emerging scholars share their experience in investigating the role of translation in generating and transforming knowledge. The program considers such questions as:
<ul>
 	<li>What are the historical, cultural, and social conditions under which translators and institutions engage in the production, dissemination, and reception of knowledge?</li>
 	<li>What are the ways in which translators have participated in the process of transmitting scientific and expert discourses across linguistic and cultural boundaries?</li>
 	<li>How were 'foreign' cultural, political, and scientific concepts transmitted, circulated, and received in Asian countries during periods of political, economic, and intellectual transformation?</li>
 	<li>Which theoretical strands (e.g. Descriptive Translation Studies, postcolonial studies, cultural studies, sociology of translation, technical translation, media studies) are relevant for studying translation of knowledge?</li>
 	<li>How does our understanding of knowledge-making affect our choice of method for gathering, analyzing, and interpreting empirical data?</li>
 	<li>What are the roles of volunteer or non-professional translators in the construction and dissemination of knowledge on the Web? How does our understanding of the interplay between translation and digital culture influence research design?</li>
</ul>
The lectures and presentations at this training event will address themes, theoretical frameworks, and methodologies related to research on the role of translation as both formative and transformative element in the production and dissemination of knowledge. The program also features workshops on developing competence in research planning and publishing academic papers in international journals.
