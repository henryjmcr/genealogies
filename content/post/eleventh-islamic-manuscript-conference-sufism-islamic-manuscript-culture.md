Magdalene College, University of Cambridge</h5>
The Islamic Manuscript Association, in partnership with the Thesaurus Islamicus Foundation and the HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Centre of Islamic Studies at the University of Cambridge, is pleased to announce its Eleventh Islamic Manuscript Conference: <em>Sufism and Islamic Manuscript Culture</em>, which will be held from 13 to 15 September 2016 at Magdalene College, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.

Sufis have written litanies, panegyrics, didactic works in verse and prose, hagiographies, discourses, exegetical works, and metaphysical treatises made into manuscripts both humble and lavish. Sufi lodges have housed libraries and manuscript ateliers, and Sufi networks have disseminated manuscripts across the Muslim World. This conference seeks to present current international research trends on the relationship between Sufism and Islamic manuscript culture and to generate discussion and study in this field.

Alongside poster presentations and a book and arts exhibit, the conference will feature three free workshops:
<ul>
 	<li><em>Exploring Painted Works: The Islamic Painted Page Database</em> will be presented by Stephen Serpell, Founder of the Islamic Painted Page;</li>
 	<li><em>An Introduction to TEI for Islamic Manuscript Descriptions</em> by Yasmin Faghihi, Head of the Near and Middle Eastern Department, Cambridge University Library, and Co-Chair, FIHRIST board, and Huw Jones, Digital Content Specialist, Cambridge University Library; and</li>
 	<li><em>Customizing Imaging Supports</em> with Cliff Cheney, Head of Imaging, Thesaurus Islamicus Foundation and Dar Al Kutub Manuscript Project, Cairo.</li>
</ul>
Simultaneous Arabic-English and English-Arabic interpretation will be available throughout the conference.
