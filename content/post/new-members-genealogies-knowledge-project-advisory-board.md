He is the author of <em>The French State in Question</em> (1993), <em>Victorian Political Thought</em> (2000), and <em>Intellect and Character in Victorian England: Mark Pattison and the Invention of the Don</em> (2007). He has also translated and edited the political writings of Auguste Comte, and co-edited a volume on pluralism in modern France. He convenes a research network on the history of the humanities, and chairs the University’s Research Group on University History. His main current project is a political and intellectual biography of James Bryce (1838-1922), the jurist, historian, humanitarian campaigner, cabinet minister, and UK ambassador to Washington.

Carsten Timmermann is a Senior Lecturer at the <a href="http://www.chstm.manchester.ac.uk/">Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine</a> at the University of Manchester. Originally trained in biochemistry before turning to the history of science, technology and medicine, his current research focuses on issues in the history of modern medicine and medical science. He has published on the history of chronic disease, especially cardiovascular conditions and cancer. His most recent books are <em>A History of Lung Cancer: The Recalcitrant Disease</em> (2013) and (with Elizabeth Toon) <em>Cancer Patients, Cancer Pathways: Historical and Sociological Perspectives</em> (2012). He has also collaborated in a project exploring the use of text mining in the history of medicine. His teaching has covered many aspects in the history of science, technology and medicine and currently includes an introduction to the history of biology, a course on the history of psychiatry, and a survey of the history of medicine. Carsten is Chair of the executive committee of the <a href="https://sshm.org/">Society for the Social History of Medicine</a>.</div>

In 1997 he graduated at the University of Rome “La Sapienza” and then completed Master (2000) and Ph.D. (2003) at the CHSTM. He then worked at the Universities of Bristol and Leeds before returning to the CHSTM in 2009. There he led a project funded by the European Research Council (<a href="http://teus.unistra.fr/">TEUS - The Earth Under Surveillance</a>) that was completed in 2014.

Simone’s main interest is in science, technology and international relations (foreign affairs, global governance, and international collaborative scientific endeavours especially in the geosciences). Other relevant interests include: climate change policy and research, nuclear energy, the interplay of scientific research, intelligence and surveillance, scientific migrations, science policy and science studies.

He has published and edited several articles and volumes. The last (ed. with Elena Aronova) focuses on science studies during the Cold War period (<em>Science Studies during the Cold War and Beyond: Paradigms Defected</em>). His forthcoming book is on the history of NATO’s science and environmental programs (<em>The Greening Alliance. Science, The Environment and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization</em>, University of Chicago Press, 2018).</div>
