<strong>The <a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/ilc/cecl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centre for English Corpus Linguistics</a> of the University of Louvain is organizing the fifth edition of the <em>Using Corpora in Contrastive and Translation Studies</em> conference series in Louvain-la-Neuve (Belgium) on 12-14 September, 2018.</strong>

{{< verticalspacer 20 >}}

UCCTS is a biennial international conference which was launched by Richard Xiao in 2008 to provide an international forum for the exploration of the theoretical and practical issues pertaining to the creation and use of corpora in contrastive and translation/interpreting studies. The 2018 edition will be dedicated to the memory of Richard, who initiated the conference series but sadly passed away in January 2016.

After almost 30 years of intensive corpus use in contrastive linguistics and translation studies, the conference aims to take stock of the advances that have been made in methodology, theory, analysis and applications, and think up new ways of moving corpus-based contrastive and translation studies forward. UCCTS2018 is meant to bring together researchers who collect, annotate, analyze corpora and/or use them to inform contrastive linguistics and translation theory and/or develop corpus-informed tools (in foreign language teaching, language testing and quality assessment, translation pedagogy, computer-aided/machine translation or other related NLP domains).

<h4><strong>Conference themes</strong></h4>
We particularly welcome papers in corpus-based contrastive and translation/interpreting studies that address the following topics:
<ul>
 	<li>Quantitative approaches in corpus-based contrastive and translation studies;</li>
 	<li>The comparative study of translated/interpreted language with other types of constrained and/or mediated language varieties (e.g. learner/non-native language, edited language);</li>
 	<li>Triangulation: the combined use of corpora and other types of data;</li>
 	<li>Register/genre variation and other factors affecting cross-linguistic analyses;</li>
 	<li>The contribution of CBTS to translation theory;</li>
 	<li>New ways of approaching translation properties/features;</li>
 	<li>Bilingual corpus use in foreign language learning/teaching;</li>
 	<li>Corpus use in translator training;</li>
 	<li>Corpus use in translation quality assessment;</li>
 	<li>Corpus use in bilingual (e-)lexicography and terminology;</li>
 	<li>Design and analysis of new types of comparable and parallel corpora, including learner translation corpora.</li>
</ul>
We also encourage the submission of papers that genuinely straddle the fields of corpus-based contrastive linguistics and translation studies.

There will be four categories of presentation:
<ul>
 	<li>Full paper (25 minutes including Q &amp; A time);</li>
 	<li>Short paper (15 minutes including Q &amp; A time);</li>
 	<li>Poster;</li>
 	<li>Software demo.</li>
</ul>
A selection of papers will be published in an edited volume and a special issue in a scientific journal.
