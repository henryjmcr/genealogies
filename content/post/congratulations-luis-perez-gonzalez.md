The Genealogies of Knowledge team is pleased to announce that one of its key members, Co-Investigator Luis Pérez-González, has been promoted to a Chair in Translation Studies at the University of Manchester, in recognition of his achievements in the field.

Professor Pérez-González is a translation studies scholar with extensive experience in corpus-driven research and the study of citizen media and activism in the digital culture. He is leading the second strand of analysis on the Genealogies of Knowledge project. This strand focuses on the ways and means by which civil society actors involved in radical democratic groups and counter-hegemonic globalisation movements contest and redefine the meaning of key cultural concepts such as democracy, citizenship and expertise today, and the extent to which the ongoing redefinition of such key concepts may be accounted for in terms of resistance to the penetration of scientific activities by capitalist ideology.</div>
