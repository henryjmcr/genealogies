<strong>Project background</strong>

<a href="http://genealogiesofknowledge.net/">Genealogies of Knowledge: The Evolution and Contestation of Concepts across Time and Space</a> is an AHRC-funded project investigating the historical evolution and transformation through translation of key concepts in political and scientific thought, that can often be traced back to the ancient Greek world.

Starting with ancient Greece through to the twenty-first century, the project will focus on translation flows involving Arabic, Latin and English – the three highly influential lingua francas that facilitated and mediated the processes of conceptual transformation and dissemination in the historical periods and cultural spaces selected for the study.

In addition, the research team will examine how established meanings and interpretations of such concepts are currently being contested and renegotiated by civil society actors involved in networked, counter-hegemonic globalisation movements.

For both strands of analysis, the study involves building large, diverse electronic corpora of target language texts in Arabic, Latin and English, as well as their Greek source texts; and developing a range of open-source tools for corpus analysis and visualisation that harness the power of the computer to process, compare and visualise patterns in these very large textual repositories.

<strong>JOB DESCRIPTION</strong>
