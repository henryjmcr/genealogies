<div class="entry-post">The <a href="http://genealogiesofknowledge.net/genealogies-knowledge-corpus/">Genealogies of Knowledge Corpus</a> is supported by a set of powerful search and visualisation software tools that are being developed specifically for this project.

Working with this software will allow the research team to trace the development and mutation of key concepts that have become a core part of our academic and public life, and their contestation and renegotiation by civil society today.

Further <a href="http://genealogiesofknowledge.net/software/">technical information</a>, examples and <a href="http://genealogiesofknowledge.net/genealogies-knowledge-corpus/#guidance">documentation</a> are now available on the project website.</div>
