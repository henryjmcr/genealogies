I received my Ph.D. from McGill University in 2014 in Islamic Philosophy. For the past three years I have worked with Peter E. Pormann on Arabic medicine on an ERC-funded project on the <em><a href="http://www.alc.manchester.ac.uk/classics-and-ancient-history/research/projects/arabic-commentaries-on-the-hippocratic-aphorisms/">Arabic Commentaries on the Hippocratic Aphorisms</a></em> (2012–2017). I am co-editing with Peter E. Pormann a special issue of <em>Oriens</em> 45.1–2 on the medical commentary tradition in medieval Islam. My recent research focuses on the conceptual and textual interaction between philosophy and medicine in classical and post-classical medieval Islamic philosophy and medicine. I am currently writing an article on how Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī (d. 1210) influenced the Islamic medical discourse in and after the thirteenth-century. My monograph, which is currently in manuscript, is a genealogy of Avicenna’s theory of logical implication.

For Genealogies of Knowledge, I am responsible for constructing the pre-modern Greek, Arabic and Latin corpora. My personal research examines how pre-modern medical Arabic was used to translate French anatomy texts for use in the newly constructed medical schools and hospitals in the Arabic-speaking world in the nineteenth-century. In addition to tracing the evolution of Arabic medical discourse from the pre-modern to the modern, my ultimate objective is to see how pre-modern Arabic was used to articulate new ideas about the nature of the body.</div>
