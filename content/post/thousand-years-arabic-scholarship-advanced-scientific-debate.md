<div class="entry-post"><em><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/gallery/2014/oct/23/-sp-the-importance-of-arabic-contributions-to-science-over-time-in-pictures?CMP=share_btn_tw">The Guardian</a></em> recently featured an article including examples of important manuscripts illustrating how, from the ninth to the nineteenth centuries, scholars and scribes used Arabic as a lingua franca to debate and develop scientific ideas. Arabic-speaking scholars translated classical Greek, Persian and even Sanskrit texts on topics such as medicine, mathematics and astronomy. These scholars went far beyond translation and preservation and fostered a unique and vibrant scientific culture within the Arabic-speaking world.

The manuscripts featured are from the British Library Qatar Foundation Partnership's new online portal - the <a href="http://www.qdl.qa/en">Qatar Digital Library</a>. The archive provides free online access to 25,000 pages of fascinating medieval Arabic manuscripts.
