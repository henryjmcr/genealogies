 	<li>demonstrate the use of corpus linguistics in the humanities, especially History</li>
 	<li>Give a sense of the incredibly wide uses that corpora have been put to;</li>
 	<li>Allow those with an interest in language, who have not heard of the corpus approach before, a new way of looking at language;</li>
 	<li>Demonstrate that corpus approaches to social science can offer valuable insight into social reality by investigating the use and manipulation of language in society.</li>
</ul>
