<h4>About the event</h4>
What is the impact of translation on the diffusion of legal concepts between domains of discourse? Does the translation of legal terminology modify the perception of the corresponding legal phenomena in observable and applied ways? How are words translated from legal discourse into everyday discourse, and does translation happen in the other direction?

The conference will include historical perspectives from the 19th century’s legal transition, theoretical perspectives on translation and linguistics in combination with law and politics, and applied perspectives on practicing and teaching legal translation in different contexts. The conference includes four keynote speakers, a roundtable debate, and 12 presentations from emergent and established scholars in the Middle East and North Africa as well as Asia, Europe and North America.
<h4><strong>Keynote Speakers:</strong></h4>
