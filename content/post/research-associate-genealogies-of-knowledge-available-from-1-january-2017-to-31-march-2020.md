<em>Genealogies of Knowledge: The Evolution and Contestation of Concepts across Time and Space</em> is a 4-year, AHRC-funded project investigating the historical evolution and transformation through translation of key concepts in political and scientific thought that can often be traced back to the ancient Greek world, focusing on translations into early medieval Arabic, Latin and modern English. The research involves compiling large electronic corpora of texts and developing software applications to interrogate them and assist with the presentation of findings to other researchers and the public.

You will work on pre-modern corpora of medieval Arabic, focusing on tracing the development and mutation of key concepts that have become a core part of our academic and public life, including concepts relating to the body politic and scientific expert discourse.

You will have a good command of classical and modern standard Arabic, a Doctorate on a topic that is relevant to the project and previous research experience involving medieval Arabic manuscripts.

Knowledge of classical Greek and Latin including Greek thought and its reception in medieval Arabic texts plus knowledge of methods and techniques of corpus linguistics and translation studies and familiarity of exegetical cultures in Arabic is desirable. Previous experience in the area of the history of medicine and philosophy is also desirable.

As an equal opportunities employer, we welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons. However, as black and minority ethnic (BME) candidates are currently under-represented at this level in this area, we would particularly welcome applications from BME applicants. All appointments will be made on merit.
