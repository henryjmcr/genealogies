<div class="entry-post">Plans for holding the first international conference organized by the Genealogies of Knowledge team are well under way.

The conference is intended to provide a space for scholars from diverse disciplinary backgrounds to discuss various aspects of the impact of translation and other processes of mediation on the evolution of concepts across time and space. It will also provide an opportunity for engaging with current discourses that contest the foundations of political and scientific life, with methodological and theoretical issues relating to the use of large electronic corpora for tracing the evolution and contestation of concepts, and with the role of historical and modern lingua francas in constructing knowledge(s) across the full spectrum of human experience.

The Call for Papers will be posted on this site and circulated among subscribers to the Genealogies mailing list by early December 2016.</div>
