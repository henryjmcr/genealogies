<div class="entry-post"><h4>Fellowship period: September 2017 – May 2018
Application deadline: January 15, 2017</h4>
The Weiser Center for Emerging Democracies (WCED) at the University of Michigan invites postdoctoral scholars to apply for the Emerging Democracies Postdoctoral Fellowship. The fellowship supports research on the broad historical, political, economic, and societal conditions under which democracies emerge—and autocracies endure.

Three awards are available in 2017-18. Emerging Democracies Postdoctoral Fellows are expected to focus on their own research, participate in WCED workshops and events, and present one public lecture during their fellowship year, while in residence at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
<h5>Eligibility</h5>
We welcome excellent applicants from all disciplines. Eligibility is restricted to those who have received their PhD after January 1, 2015 and before beginning the fellowship.
