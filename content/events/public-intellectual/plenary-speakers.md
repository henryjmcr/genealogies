<strong>TO WHOM DOES THE BODY BELONG? MODERN MEDICINE AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IN TIMES OF UPHEAVAL</strong>

Forensic medicine played a central role during the Egyptian uprising of 2011-2013. From determining the cause of death of hundreds of demonstrators, to deciding whether or not the deposed president, Hosni Mubarak, could stand trial; and from performing infamous "virginity tests" that the army enforced on female demonstrators, to adjudicating hundreds of torture cases, forensic doctors found their expertise called upon to speak on behalf of mute, sometimes dead, bodies. Drawing on historical research on nineteenth-century Egyptian forensic medicine as well as ethnographic research on the present Egyptian Forensic Medicine Authority, this talk will analyze the role of the forensic doctor in moments of national upheaval, and how her/his expertise often proves decisive in people's quest for justice.</td>

He then went to the University of Oxford where he wrote his DPhil dissertation on the history of the Egyptian army during the first half of the nineteenth century. After receiving his doctorate in 1993, Fahmy moved to the US where he worked first at Princeton University then at New York University. After seventeen years in the US, he returned to his home country in 2010, and joined his alma mater, AUC, as chair of the Department of History. In 2013, Fahmy returned to the US, this time as a visiting fellow at Columbia University, then as a visiting professor at Harvard University. He joined the University of Cambridge in 2017.

<strong>THE POLITICS OF THE CLASSICAL: LANGUAGE AND AUTHORITY IN THE 19TH CENTURY</strong>

For several centuries, the languages and civilisations of classical antiquity occupied an exemplary status in European culture and society. This paper looks at the maintenance of and challenges to this status, and the ways in which its demise led to new forms of knowledge and to new kinds of intellectual authority. ‘Classics’ is seen as form of social action in which exemplary pasts are deployed to maintain stability and universality against change and relativity. In the nineteenth century this was undermined by the normalisation of change (historicity) and the emergence of powerful alternative sources of value. Classical languages (Greek, Latin, and to some extent Hebrew) had been used for both communication and boundary maintenance; their declining status led to the modern academic formations, in which an interim phase (academic knowledge exemplified by the rigours of Latin) gave way to the formal parity of all academic knowledge.</td>
