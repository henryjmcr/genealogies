<div class="entry-post"><h4><em>Researching Citizen Media - Methods and Ethics</em></h4>
&nbsp;
<h4>An interdisciplinary workshop to be held at the University of Manchester, UK</h4>
<h4>15-16 September 2016</h4>
&nbsp;

Heightened distrust in traditional forms of governance and mainstream media
industries has given rise to alternative repertoires of action that now occupy a
prominent place in public consciousness across the globe. In this context,
unaffiliated individuals and collectives have come to play an important role in
articulating various forms of political and aesthetic expression, whether in physical
sites (as in the case of street art and parkour), on virtual platforms (blogging,
mockumentaries, fansubbing), or across hybrid environments that combine
embodied and digital practices, as in the case of documentary film-making. In
producing and disseminating such citizen media content, engaged individuals and
collectives seek to reclaim public and digital spaces in pursuit of noninstitutionalized
agendas, effect aesthetic or socio-political change, and express
personal desires and aspirations.

Conducting research in this fluid, fast changing and sometimes high risk
environment poses numerous methodological and ethical challenges that are yet to
be adequately explored. This event will offer a platform for discussing these
challenges and sharing research experiences that involve different forms and
platforms of citizen media.
